1) License for this software (summary)
--------------------------------------
- The combined work (the “Combined Work”) is distributed under the **GNU GPL v2.0 or later (GPL-2.0-or-later)**.
- This software is distributed **without any warranty**; without even the implied warranties of merchantability
  or fitness for a particular purpose.
- The location of the **Corresponding Source** is the URL shown above.
- For the full license text, see `licenses/COPYING.GPL-2.0.txt` (or the official URL file placed under `licenses/`).
  For offline distribution, it is recommended to include the full GPL text file.

2) Reuse conditions for our own code
------------------------------------
- Files newly authored by us (not derived from Pizza.py) are **also reusable under the MIT License** when used on
  their own. When distributed as part of the Combined Work, **GPL terms prevail**. See the `NOTICE` file for details.

3) Main third-party components and licenses
-------------------------------------------
- **PySide6 (Qt for Python)** — LGPL-3.0 (dynamic linking assumed)
  - You must provide the license text and a means for users to **relink against a modified library**.
    Because “onefile” packaging can make replacement difficult, we **recommend onefolder packaging**.
- **NumPy / NetworkX / VTK / python-louvain** — BSD 3-Clause
- **Python runtime** — PSF License
- **Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime** — subject to Microsoft’s redistributable terms
- Example shipped with the product: **compaction_LIGGGHTS** — MIT (see the license included in its repository)

  The license texts and attributions for these components are available under the installed `licenses/` directory.

4) Important: complying with the LGPL (PySide6)
-----------------------------------------------
- This application uses PySide6. Distribution assumes **dynamic linking** or another arrangement that allows the user
  to relink the application with a **modified** version of the library.
- If you ship a “onefile” build, document a practical method for users to replace PySide6 at the runtime extraction
  location so that **relinking with a modified library remains possible**; otherwise prefer a **onefolder** layout.

5) Confirmation to proceed with installation

- By clicking “Next”, you acknowledge that you have read the summary above, that the software is **provided as-is
  without warranty**, and that the full texts of the relevant licenses are available under `licenses/` (or official
  URLs are provided there).
